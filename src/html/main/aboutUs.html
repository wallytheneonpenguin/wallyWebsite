          <b>Hello fellow penguins, fans, and curious cats,</b>
          <br/><br/>
          Since I was born, I've spent all my life in and around Calgary, Canada. Growing
          up in a small city nearby, I grew up your basic sports kid. It wasn't until I moved
          to Calgary in 2005 that I started getting a real interest in music specifically Classic Rock
          and Hip-Hop. Starting off with the big names like Led Zeppelin, Dr. Dre, Notorious B.I.G. and The Doors I slowly opened
          up the door to thousands of hours of music. After one day realizing "If I like Dr. Dre's beats, the music he sampled must
          be incredible", I went further and further down a rabbit hole which has given me an appreciation
          for all genre's.
          <br/><br/>
          In 2012, I decided with the persuasion of a friend to start making beats, I began
          a decade long path of self learning the basics of making Hip-Hop beats, which frankly
          kept me busy for at least a decade. During this time, I was in a group called The Wracket and after
          a change in interests from all parties, I decided to try something completely different.
          <br/><br/>
          The reason I ultimately landed on Electronic/EDM is simply put, it's one of my favorite 
          genre's and even when making hip-hop beats for a decade, I was always dreaming that 
          if I went solo, it would be in this genre. Although I imagine it will be a learning curve,
          I hope to get better with each passing song and each passing video. 
          <br/><br/>

          <i>Sincerely,</i><br/>
